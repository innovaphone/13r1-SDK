    <h1>task</h1>
    <p>
        An interface that encapsulates asynchronous tasks, that can be started,
        then take some time and finally suceed or fail.
        Applications can use this interface as a base class for their task.
    </p>
    <h2>class ITask</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>void Start(class UTask * user)</dt>
        <dd>
            Called, in order to start an asynchronous Task.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>class UTask</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>void TaskComplete(class ITask * const task)</dt>
        <dd>
            Callback that is called if the task is completed successfully.
            If the implementation needs to return data as a result of the task,
            this is outside the scope of the ITask interface.
            Instead implementations should provid getter functions for result data.
        </dd>
        <dt>void TaskFailed(class ITask * const task)</dt>
        <dd>
            Callback that is called if the task failed.
        </dd>
        <dt>void TaskProgress(class ITask * const task, dword progress)</dt>
        <dd>
            Callback that is called if there was some progress to the task.
            The nummeric value 'progress' can be used to indicate additional information
            about the type of the progress.
        </dd>
    </dl>
