    <h1>Database</h1>
    <div class="fixme">@msm Check me!</div>
    <p>
        The Database interface is an abstraction of different database libraries to allow
        acces do different databases (for now, only PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported).
        The interface only allows simply acces (Connect, Send SQL statement, close),
        which will be enough in most cases. However, nearly everything you can do with the
        SQL features supported by the database engine, you can do with IDatabase.
    </p>

    <h2> class IDatabaseProvider </h2>
    <p>
        This class will be used to create an IDatabase instance.
        The instance of that class will be created with <i>CreatePostgreSQLDatabaseProvider()</i>
        to use the PostgreSQL driver or <i>CreateMySQLDatabaseProvider()</i> to use the MySQL driver.
        Please note that the SQL support of both of them could be different because of different
        SQL language extensions of the databases.
        After useage, the IDatabaseProvider instance should deleted if no longer be used.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>static IDatabase * CreateDatabase(class IIoMux * const iomux, class UDatabase * const user, class IInstanceLog * log)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will create an IDatabase instance. iomux is the IIoMux instance of the application,
            user the UDatabase instance that will receive the callbacks.<br />
            The IInstanceLog interface provides AppInstance related logs which are controlled by the log flag LOD_DATABASE.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2> class IDatabase </h2>
    <p>
        This is the main calss that handels the communication between the Application and the database server.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>A note to what happens when an error occures:</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If an SQL command failes, all pending commands of the user that sends that
                    one that fails will be removed from the internal queue.
                    The user itself will receive an UDatabase::DatabaseError().
                    If the user had an active queue lock or an transaction,
                    IDatabase will make a rollback, unlock tables (if locked) and unlock
                    the internal queue.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If an critical error occures that makes it impossible to continue
                    using IDatabase, all pending commands of all users will be discarded and these
                    users will receive a UDatabase::DatabaseError().
                    The database connection will be closed and the main user (that one
                    that created the IDatabase instance) will receive an
                    UDatabase::DatabaseShutdown().
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>void Connect(const char * address, const char * dbname, const char * user, const char * password)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will connect to the databsae at the given address, using the database given in dbname,
            authenticating with the given user name and password.
            The address can be an IP address or a hostname (with an optionally port seperated by ':')
            or a path to aan local socket - depending on the configuration of the database server.
            If the connection was successfull, UDatabase::DatabaseConnectComplete() will be called,
            otherwise UDatabase::Shotdown() with an appropriate error code.
        </dd>

        <dt>bool Connected()</dt>
        <dd>
            Returns true, if the connection to the server is active, or not of not.
            Note that after calling Shutdown(), this function will return false even if the connection
            to the server not had been closed yet.
        </dd>

        <dt>void Shutdown()</dt>
        <dd>
            Closes the connection to the database.
            That function should be called before deleting the IDatabase instance.
            Shutdown will wait for active callbacks to be completed and call UDatabase::DatabaseShutdown().
        </dd>

        <dt>size_t QueryPrint(char * buffer, size_t bufferSize, const char * sqlcmd, ...)</dt>
        <dd>
            Used to build up a query string. The query will be stored inside buffer with a maximum of bufferSize. The sql command
            itself has to be passed in sqlcmd. That string could have placeholders, which will be replaced with the values of
            the data given in a variable parameters list after sqlcmd. This helps to prevent SQL interjection, so it is recommended
            to build up a query string using QueryPrint. The length of the build up query string will be returned by QueryPrint.
            For the placeholders, a printf like syntax is used with the following types:
            <ul>
                <li><b>%i</b> Placeholder for an integer</li>
                <li><b>%u</b> Placeholder for an unsigned integer (dword)</li>
                <li><b>%lli</b> Placeholder for an 64 bit integer (long64)</li>
                <li><b>%llu</b> Placeholder for an 64 bit unsigned integer (ulong64)</li>
                <li><b>%b</b> Placeholder for a bool</li>
                <li>
                    <b>%q</b> Placeholder for a string that will be copied directly, without quoting or escaping of the strings data.
                    Can be used to insert an alrady prepared query string.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>%du</b> Placeholder for a buffer. The value of the buffer will be copied as a hex string, starting with \x. Note
                    that an additional parameter must be passed (size_t) to tell the size of the buffer.
                </li>
                <li><b>%s</b> Placeholder for a string. The string will be enclosed by '.</li>
                <li><b>%S</b> Placeholder for a string. The string will be enclosed by ".</li>
                <li><b>%n</b> Placeholder for a string that will be insert to the SQL command without enclosing it to ' or ".</li>
                <li>
                    <b>%p</b> Suffix to pass a pointer instead of a value.
                    Only in combination with integer or bool variants (%pi, %pu, %pb, %plli, %pllu).
                    When using with prepared statements, that suffix will be ignored.
                    <b>Note:</b> This can be used to set a field to NULL by pasing NULL
                    instead of a valid pointer. If you need to set a string field to NULL,
                    simply pass NULL when using %s, %S or %n.
                </li>
                <li><b>%%</b> An escaped % sign. </li>

            </ul>
            Note: You don't need to call QueryPrint first before calling ExeclSQL or InsertSQL. Theese functions calling query
            print by themselfes.
        </dd>

        <dt>void ExecSQL(UDatabase * const user, dword flags, const char * sqlcmd, ...)</dt>
        <dd>
            Executes the given sql command. The result will be send to UDatabase::DatabaseExecSQLResult().
            user is the user instance to send the result to (or a DatabaseError(), if an error occured).
            If user is NULL, the default user (that one who was given to IDatabase while creating an instanz)
            will be used. Flags can be one of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    DB_EXEC_FETCH_ALL'''  Normally IDatabase reads the result of an execution
                    query row by row.
                    This flag tells IDatabase to fetch all rows at once.
                    Note that the handling of that data with the IDataset given to
                    UDatabase::DatabaseExecSQLResult() will be slightly different.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The sql command given in sqlcmd can have placeholders. See QueryPrint for more details. If you whant to call
            an insert sql command an get the autoincrement id of that insert command, user InsertSQL instead.
        </dd>

        <dt>void InsertSQL(UDatabase * const user, const char * sqlcmd, ...)</dt>
        <dd>
            Executes an INSERT command. The parameters are the same as for ExecSQL().
            The difference is, that instead of UDatabase::ExecSQLResult(),
            UDatabase::DatabaseInsertSQLResult(IDatabase * const database, dword id)
            will be called with the id of the new insert row.
            To make this work you have to create a table that as some kind of autoincrement id.
            The sql command given in sqlcmd can have placeholders. See QueryPrint for more details.
        </dd>

        <dt>void ExecSQL(UDatabase * const user, dword flags, class IPreparedStatement * const statement)</dt>
        <dd>
            Same es ExecSQL() above, only that an prepared statement will be used to execute
            instad of a command string.
        </dd>

        <dt>void InsertSQL(UDatabase * const user, class IPreparedStatement * const statement)</dt>
        <dd>
            Same as InsertSQL() above, only that an prepared statement will be used to execute
            instad of a command string.
        </dd>

        <dt>size_t QueryPrintV(char * buffer, size_t bufferSize, const char * sqlcmd, va_list argList)</dt>
        <dt>void ExecSQLV(UDatabase * const user, dword flags, const char * sqlcmd, va_list argList)</dt>
        <dt>void InsertSQLV(UDatabase * const user, const char * sqlcmd, va_list argList)</dt>
        <dt>
            These functions are the same as QueryPrint / ExecSQL / InsertSQL with the difference, that the variable parametrs list
            will be given using a va_list pointer. If you don't know what that is, you probably don't need it.
        </dt>

        <dt>void PrepareStatement(UDatabase * user, const char * sqlcmd)</dt>
        <dd>
            Creates a prepared statement that can be executed using ExecSQL() or InsertSQL().
            user will be the user that receives the answer to that call
            (will be the user that created the IDatabase intsance if set to NULL),
            sqlcmd the SQL command of the prepared statement.
            Parameters that should be used for that SQL command will be defined with
            placeholders as described in ExecSQL().
            However, the values of that parameters will be set inside the IPreparedStatement
            object before passing it to ExecSQL() or InsertSQL().
            On success, the new created IPreparedStatement instance will be passed to
            UDatabase::PrepareStatementResult().
            It's the applications responsebility to delete that object if no longer needed.
        </dd>

        <dt>void LockQueue(UDatabase * const user = NULL)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will lock the internal queue of commands. That lock will become active,
            when all other parts inside the queue before LockQueue() will be called, had been processed.
            After that, all commands inside the internal queue that should send their result
            to the given user (which is the main user if user == NULL),
            will be handled first until an unlock for the queue had been given.
            Doing this helps to group SQL commands when the IDatabase instance will be used
            from more than only one user.
        </dd>

        <dt>void UnlockQueue(UDatabase * const user = NULL)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will end the queue locking.
            You must call that function if you now longer need the locking of the internal command queue.
        </dd>

        <dt>void BeginTransaction(UDatabase * const user, const char * lockTableCmd = NULL)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will start a transaction block.
            The result of the command will be send to the given user (or to the main user,
            if NULL will be given).
            If an an additional table lock command is necessary,
            it must be given to lockTableCmd.
            <b>Note:</b> Never send a lock command with a normal ExecSQL, or the lock will not been
            canceld if an error occures. BeginTransaction() will call LockQueue() to group the commands.
            On success, UDatabase::ExecSQLResult() will be called.
        </dd>

        <dt>void EndTransaction(UDatabase * const user, bool doRollback = false)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will end a transaction. User must be the same value as given to BeginTransaction().
            If an lock table command had been given to BeginTransaction(),
            EndTransaction() will make sure that the table will be unlocked.
            EndTransaction() will also call UnlockQueue().
            On success, UDatabase::ExecSQLResult() will be called.
        </dd>

        <dt>const char * GetLastErrorMessage()</dt>
        <dd>
            Returns the readable message of the last error occurred. This message is provided by the database system itself. So read
            the documentation of the database system used to get more informations about the language and format of the error message.            
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2> class IPreparedStatement </h2>
    <p>
        A prepared statement will be created by calling IDatabase::PrepareStatement()
        and receiving the result via UDatabase::DatabasePrepareStatementResult().
        PreparedStatements come in handy, if you use a static SQL command a multiple times
        while only changing the parameters (if there are any).
        With this, the execution will be faster than using a SQL command that needs to be
        parsed each time of execution.
        According to the ducumentation of the databsae systems (like PostgreSQL or MySQL),
        unter some circumstances a prepared statement will not be faster or even slower
        than a simple SQL command, so it had to be tested, if the application becomes slow.
        Instances of IPreparedStatement can be shared between different instances of
        worker classes, because ExecSQL() and InsertSQL() are managing the paremeters
        of a prepared statment with reference counting.
        Doing this, the paremeter of an prepared statement inside the execution queue of
        IDatabase will never change, even if the will be changed elsewhere later.
        Note that when you share an IPreparedStatement instance, there is no guarantee
        that the parameters set before the last IDatabase::ExecSQL() or IDatabase::InsertSQL()
        call are still the same. Because of this it will be a good idea to set all parameters
        before passing the prepared statement to an IDatabase instance, even if only some
        of them had been changed.
    </p>

        <dd>

        <dt>void SetParam(dword idx, const char * value)</dt>
        <dd>
            Set the parameter at index idx to the given value.
            Parameters will be defined buy using placeholders inside the SQL command in
            IDatabase::PrepareStatement(). Look at IDatabase::ExecSQL() for details.
            The only difference is, that %s, %S and %n will be treated in the same way
            and the %p suffix will be ignored, too (use the functions below the
            used pointers).
            The first placeholder inside the given SQL command will be the parameter at index 0,
            the second one the parameter at index 1 and so on.
            If the datatype given to SetParam() is not the same as defined within the SQL command
            while calling IDatabase::PrepareStatement(), an assertion will be raised.
            Note that you have to set the parameters before calling IDatabase::ExecSQL()
            or IDatabase::InsertSQL().
            <b>Note:</b> When you pass NULL to SetParam(dword idx, const char * value),
            the field will set to NULL, too.
        </dd>

        <dt>void SetParam(dword idx, int * value)</dt>
        <dd>
        </dd>

        <dt>void SetParam(dword idx, double * value)</dt>
        <dd>
            Same as the above versions, so with the difference that they will accept
            a pointer instead of the direct value.
            If the given pointer is NULL, the field itself will be set to NULL, too.
        </dd>

    <h2> class IDataSet </h2>
    <p>
        An instance of this class will be given to UDatabase::ExecSQLResult().
        It holds the result of the last SQL statement send with IDatabase::ExecSQL and
        will be used to acces the data.
        Note that the application has to delete the instance after it will no longer
        be used, to let IDatabase handle the next request inside the internal queue.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>size_t GetColumnCount()</dt>
        <dd>
            Returns the number of columns of the result set.
        </dd>

        <dt>bool Eot()</dt>
        <dd>
            Will return true if the end of the table had been reached, else false.
            Don't access to the data of the IDataSet after Eot returns true!
            If Eot() returns false, IDataset now longer will be used and should be deleted.
        </dd>

        <dt>void Next()</dt>
        <dd>
            Fetches the next row of the dataset.
            This function only can be used if all of the data already had been fetched
            by calling IDatabase::ExecSQL with the flag DB_EXEC_FETCH_ALL.
            After a call to Next() it is necessary to first check if the end of the table
            had been reached by calling IDatabase::Eot(), before accessing the data.
        </dd>

        <dt>void FetchNextRow()</dt>
        <dd>
            Reads the next row from the server.
            This only could be used if IDatabase::ExecSQL() had been called
            without the DB_EXEC_FETCH_ALL flag. Instead of IDataSet::Next(),
            FetchNextRow() will not directly load the next row, it will request the next row.
            That means, that it will lead to an other UDatabase::DatabaseExecSQLResult()
            with the same IDataset instance.
            Because of this an application each time has to check IDataSet::Eot() first inside
            DatabaseExecSQLResult(), before accessing the data.

        <dt>void DatabaseShutdown(IDatabase * const database, db_error_t reason)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the connection to the database server had been
            closed successfully.
            database will be the calling instance; reason one of the following constants:

                <li>DB_ERR_SERVER_ERROR: An other error occured (like an internal server error or a connection lost).</li>
            </ul>
            DatabaseShutdown() is a good place to delete the IDatabase instance.
            But make sure tha only the user that created the instance will delete it.
            If not, the application will crash with a segmentation fault!

            database will be the calling instance, dataset the IDataset with the result
            set of the last SQL statement.
            The application itself will be responsible to release the database object.
            Note that IDatabase will wait with the execution of the next commad inside
            the internal queue, until the dataset instance had been deleted.
            Because of this, don't save that object for later use.
            It will be better to read out all data and process them as soon as possible
            (or store them temporarily enywhere else), so that dataset can be deleted
            soon to not block other SQL commands send to IDatabase.

            database will be the calling instance, id the id of the new created row.
            Note that this only works, if using a table with some kind of autoincrement id field.

        <dt>void DatabaseBeginTransactionResult(IDatabase * const database)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the execution of IDatabase::BeginTransaction().
            database will be the calling instance. Note that DatabaseBeginTransactionResult()
            will be called after begining a transaction and executing the optional lock
            command, if given to BeginTransaction().
        </dd>

        <dt>void DatabaseEndTransactionResult(IDatabase * const database)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the execution if IDatabase::EndTransaction().

        <dd>
            Will be called after the execution of IDatabase::PrepareStatement().
            database will be the calling instance, statement the IPreparedStatement instance
            the application can use.
            Note that it will be the responsebility of the application to delete the object,
            if no longer needed.

        <dt>virtual void DatabaseError(IDatabase * const database, db_error_t error)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called an error occures while executing a command.
            database will be the calling instance, error the error number.
            For now, it normaly will be DB_ERR_SQL_COMMAND_FAILED.
            DatabaseError() will be called for that user, whose SQL command failed.
            All other pending commands of that user will be discarded.
            If an critical error occures during command execution, all pending commands
            of all users will be discarded and the main user (that one that created
            the IDatabase instance) will receive a DatabaseShutdown().
