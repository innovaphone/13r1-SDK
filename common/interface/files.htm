    <h1>files</h1>
    <p>
        Interface for asyncronous reading and writing of files in an &lt;app-instance&gt;.files folder. The file
        to be read/written is identified by a ulong64 id, which is converted to a filename with
        _sprintf(name, "%llu", id).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: currently the implementation is blocking, but could be changed to non-blocking without change
        to the app.

    <hr/><h2>class IFilesProvider * CreateFilesProvider(class IIoMux * iomux)</h2>
    <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <p>
        Function to allocate the FilesProvider resource, to be called from the app-main, so that the real
        FileProvider can be replaced by a unit-test implementation.
    </p>
    <h2>class IFiles * IFilesProvider::CreateFiles(class IInstanceLog * const log, const char * serviceId, const char * path)</h2>
    <p>
        Allocate the FilesProvider for a given instance. <br/> 
        serviceId should be AppService->GetAppServiceId(),  path should be the same as the dbName, it is used
        to create the actual path on the system for the files in the form /apps/&lt;serviceId&gt;/&lt;dbName&gt;.files, which
        is a folder created by the taskmanager for the app.
        log is used to log dependent of the log flag LOG_FILES.

    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>class IFilesWrite * Write(class UTask * user, ulong64 id)</dt>
        <dd>
            Initiates a write operation. The allocated IFilesWrite class is derived from ITask, so the ITask/UTask
            mechanisms are used for progress and completion

        <dt>class IFilesRead * Read(class UTask * user, ulong64 id, unsigned length, unsigned offset = 0, bool progress = false)</dt>
        <dd>
            Initiates a read operation. The allocated IFilesRead class is derived from ITask, so the ITask/UTask
            mechanisms are used for progress and completion. <b>length</b> is the length of the initial block,
            to be read. This block is available at the first TaskProgress callback.
            <b>offset</b> is the offset inside the file from which reading should start.
            <b>progress</b> indicates that a TaskProgress call should be used always when the data
            is available, even if this is the last data. In this case TaskComplete is
            called after the next read, when the file is closed.

    <dl>
        <dt>class IFilesDel * Del(class UTask * user, ulong64 id)</dt>

            Initiates a delete operation. The allocated IFilesDel class is derived from ITask, so the ITask/UTask
            mechanisms are used for completion.

            <dd>
                Write a block of data to the file. This function may be called in the TaskProgress
                callback or assynchronously after the first TaskProgress call. The passed buffer
                may be freed on return from the call. <b>last</b> indicates the last block of data, when
                set the file is closed and the task completes.
            </dd>

            <dt>ulong64 GetId() const</dt>
            <dd>
                Returns the id of the file.

            <dt>const char * GetAbsoluteFileName() const</dt>
            <dd>
                Returns the absolute path file name of the file, if needed for a command execution.

                Initiates reading of the next block. May be called after TaskProgress for the
                previous block.

                    <dt>last</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Indicates that this is the last block of data to read. The task terminates
                        after this, even if there is more data available

                Get a pointer to the read block of data. May be called after the TaskProgress
                for the read operation. The pointer is valid until the next call to Read. A length
                of 0 indicates the end of file.
