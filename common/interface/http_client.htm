    <h1>http_client</h1>
    <p>
        IHTTPClient is simple HTTP client. For now the client only supports basic functionality (GET, POST)as well as NTLM authentication for the connection.

    <h2> class IHTTPClient </h2>
    <dl>
        <dt> static IHTTPClient * Create(class IIoMux * const iomux,
                                class ISocketProvider * const tcpSocketProvider,
                                class ISocketProvider * const tlsSocketProvider,
                                class UHTTPClient * const user,
                                class IInstanceLog * const log);</dt>
        <dd>
            Creates an ITTHClient instance. iomux has to be a iomux instance of the application. The two socket provider
			will be used to create a normal connection (tcpSocketProvider) or a connection that uses TLS enctyption (tlsSocketProvider). user must be an UHTTPClient instance. The returned instance needs to be deleted after it is no longer used. 
            log is used to log dependent of the log flag LOG_HTTP_CLIENT.
        </dd>

        <dt>void Connect(const char * address,
                         const char * user = NULL,
                         const char * pwd = NULL,
                         int authMethods = HTTP_AUTH_ALL)</dt>
        <dd>
            Establishes a connection to the given address (which can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address as well as a URI). The values
			user and pwd will be used to authenticate with the server, if neccessary. The kind of supported authentications
			will given to authMethods as an combined list (HTTP_AUTH_NTLM | HTTP_AUTH_DIGEST | HTTP_AUTH_BASIC or HTTP_AUTH_ALL for all). 
            After the connection hat been established, HTTPClientConnectComplete() of the user will be called. There you need to set
			everything you need to send a request. If the connection failes, the http client will call HTTPClientShutdown() of the user.
            If address is an URI, it may directly contain user and pwd, e.g. http://user:pwd@test.test.com . If user and pwd are not
            given otherwise, these values are then used for authentication.
        </dd>

        <dt>void SetRequestType(http_request_type_t reqType, const char * resourceName, size_t contentLength = 0, const char * contentType = "text/xml; charset=utf-8)</dt>
        <dd>
			Befor sending the request, the application first needs to send the type of the request as well as the resourceName
			it whants to access. For now, only the request types HTTP_GET, HTTP_PUT and HTTP_POST are supported.<br />
            If reqType is not HTTP_GET and you do not know the final content length, set contentLength to HTTP_CLIENT_CHUNKED_TRANSFER for a chunked transfer.
        </dd>

        <dt>void SetCustomHeaderField(const char * field, const char * value)</dt>
        <dd>
			If there is need to set an additional header field, SetCustomHeaderField() needs to be called. field will
			be the name of the field, value the value to set.
        </dd>

        <dt>void Send(const byte * data = NULL, size_t size = 0, bool last = false)</dt>
        <dd>
			Will send the request to the server the IHTTPClient is connected with. The application first hast to
			call SetRequestType() (and eventually SetCustomHeaderField()), before calling Send(). Send() at first will
			prepare the HTTP header. After that, the header will be send. If additional data has been given to Send(),
			it will be send too. If there is need for an authentication, IHTTPClient will authenticate and send the data
			again. The user will receive a HTTPClientSendResult() afterwards.
            A HTTPClientRequestComplete callback is additionally received if the request is complete.
        </dd>
		
        <dt>void Recv(byte * buffer, size_t size)</dt>
        <dd>
			Call this function with a valid buffer and the size of the buffer to receive a requested file by using
			HTTP_GET with SetRequestType(). When the data arrives, HTTPClientRecvResult() of the user will be called.
			This function will always make a partitial read. That means, that a HTTPClientRecvResult() will be called with
			after 1 - size bytes had been read.
        </dd>

        <dt>void Shutdown()</dt>
        <dd>
			Makes a shutdown of the HTTP client. After done, HTTPClientConnectComplete() of the user will be called.
        </dd>
		
        <dt>http_result_t GetHTTPResult()</dt>
        <dd>
			Returns the result of the last request. The return value will be one of the following constants:
			 <ul>
                <li>HTTP_RESULT_OK: The request was successful.</li>
                <li>HTTP_RESULT_NOT_FOUND: The given resource could not be found.</li>
                <li>HTTP_RESULT_BAD_REQUEST: The server reports a bad request (e. G. some malformed header field).</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>size_t GetContentLength(bool & chunked)</dt>
        <dd>
            Returns the value of the HTTP Content-Length header. chunked is true for chunked transfers.
        </dd>
		
	</dl>
	
    <h2> class UHTTPClient </h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>void HTTPClientConnectComplete(IHTTPClient * const httpClient)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the connection to the server had been successfully established. Here is the right place
			to setup up the request type (by calling SetRequestType()) and send the request. httpClient is the calling
			instance.
        </dd>
		
        <dt>void HTTPClientShutdown(IHTTPClient * const httpClient, http_shutdown_reason_t reason)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the HTTP client had been closed. httpClient will be the calling instace, reason the
			reason of the shutdown, which will be one of the following constants:
			 <ul>
                <li>HTTP_SHUTDOWN_NORMAL: a normal shutdown initiated by the application itself by calling IHTTPClient::Shutdown().</li>
                <li>HTTP_SHUTDOWN_BY_PEER: The other side of the connection has initiated the shutdown.</li>
                <li>HTTP_SOCKET_LOST: The socket had been lost.</li>
                <li>HTTP_ADDRESS_INVALID: The address given to IHTTPClient::Connect() was invalid.</li>
                <li>HTTP_SOCKET_ERROR: An socket error occured.</li>
                <li>HTTP_CONNECT_FAILED: Creating the connection failed.</li>
                <li>HTTP_BYTE_STREAM_BROKEN: There was an error inside the byte stream while receiving data or authenticating.</li>
                <li>HTTP_UNHANDLED_HTTP_RESULT: An not expected HTTP result had been returned by the server.</li>
                <li>HTTP_FAILURE: En error had been found in the response http header, sent by the server.</li>
                <li>HTTP_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED: The authentication failed (e. G. because of wrong username / password or an unsupported authentication method).</li>
            </ul>			
        </dd>

        <dt>void HTTPClientSendResult(IHTTPClient * const httpClient)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the Send() had been completed. httpClient is the calling instance.<br />
        </dd>
		
        <dt>void HTTPClientRequestComplete(IHTTPClient * const httpClient)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called if the HTTP request has been successfully completed.
        </dd>		

        <dt>void HTTPClientRecvResult(IHTTPClient * const httpClient, byte * buffer, size_t len, bool transferComplete)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called after the application called IHTTPClient::Recv() and data had been received. httpClient is the
			calling instance, buffer the buffer containing the received data. len the size of the data. transferComplete
			will be true, if there is no more data to receive. If transferComplete is false, the application should make
			an other Recv() call.
        </dd>		

        <dt>void HTTPClientRecvCanceled(IHTTPClient * const httpClient, byte * buffer)</dt>
        <dd>
            Will be called before UHTTPClient::HTTPClientShutdown() if a receive data buffer had
            been passed through IHTTPClient::Recv() and not returned back via
            UHTTPClient::HTTPClientRecvResult(). If the buffer was allocated individually this
            gives the opportunity to free it.
