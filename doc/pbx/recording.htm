    <h1>Recording</h1>

    <p>
        On phones as on media-relay interfaces in gateway, a recording URL can be configured. When this URL is
        configured, for each call, the media of the call is sent via HTTP PUT (WebDav) to a webserver. The media
        data is sent as pcap file, containing unencrypted RTP streams along with a dummy SIP signaling, so that
        wireshark can directly decode the media stream. The coding of the media stream is as it was used for
        the conversiation.
    </p>

    <h2>File name used for the PUT</h2>

    <p>
        The URL used for the PUT is what is configured as recording URL. To this URL a filename is added
        which is used to encode some basic information about the call, so that it can be matched to
        information received thru RCC or the CDR records
    </p>
    <p>
        Filename format:
        <pre><code>&lt;guid&gt;-&lt;mac&gt;-&lt;serial&gt;(-&lt;reg-name&gt;)</code></pre>
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>guid</dt>
        <dd>
            The confernce id of the call. This conference id is identical at all legs of the call, so recordings
            done on different devices of the same call, can all be associated to the call. The conference id is
            also sent in the CDRs of a call.
        </dd>
        <dt>mac</dt>
        <dd>
            MAC address of the device, which performed the recording
        </dd>
        <dt>serial</dt>
        <dd>
            Serial number of the recording, to build a unique file name in case a call is recorded multiple
            times from the same device.
        </dd>
        <dt>reg-name</dt>
        <dd>
            If a registration name is available it is added to the filename
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>File format</h2>

    <p>
        The file format is PCAP. A dummy SIP signaling is added, so that wireshark can find the RTP streams. For
        the RTP streams fixed port numbers are used, 16386 for the local side and 16388 for the remote side.
    </p>
    <p>
        The media is provided with the same coder as it was sent on the actual conversation, but without any
        encryption. If the data shall be sent encrypted to the recorder, a HTTPS URL should be used.
