    <h1>appwebsocket</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>
        The appwebsocket library contains a class AppWebsocket, which can be used as base class
        for a session object allocated for incoming websocket connections. This class handles the
        authentication protocol using the myPBX authentication. It relates to the
        innovaphone.appwebsocket.js library on the client side. There are member functions
        for sending and receiving messages.
    </p>
    <h3>Protocol</h3>
    <p>
        JSON messages are used on this interface. There are some common properties, which are defined
        by the this library already appart from these the application is free to define its own
        protocol. Nevertheless there are some recommendation of how to define such an interface.

    </p>
    <h3>APIs</h3>
    <p>
        The library uses the mechanism defined by <a href="../interface/json_api.htm">json_api.h</a>
        to plug-in code to implement a specific API, which is addressed by the "api" property. Any App
        may use or provide APIs. These are documented in the context of these Apps. There are also
        libraries using this API mechanism (e.g. <a href="../interface/replication.htm">Replication</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The innovaphone PBX provides a set of APIs: <a href="pbx_apis.htm">PBX APIs</a>

    <h2>Tuturial</h2>

    <h2>AppWebsocket(IWebserverPlugin * plugin, class IInstanceLog * const log)</h2>
    <p>
        Contructor function. To be called with the IWebserverPlugin * passed in the
        WebserverWebsocketListenResult function.
        log is used to log dependent of the log flag LOG_APP_WEBSOCKET.
    </p>
    <h2>virtual char * AppWebsocketPassword()</h2>
    <p>
        Called by the library to read the shared secret, which is part of the App instance
        configuration.
    </p>
    <h2>virtual char * AppWebsocketPassword(const char * domain)</h2>
    <p>
        Called by the library to read another domain dependent shared secret, if the first shared secret failed.<br />
        Returns NULL by default which prevents another digest calculation by default.
    </p>
    <h2>virtual const char * AppWebsocketInstanceDomain()</h2>
    <p>
        Called by the library to read the App Instance domain. It is sent within the AppLoginResult
        message as property "domain".
    </p>
    <h2>virtual bool AppWebsocketConnectComplete()</h2>
    <p>
        Will be called after the connection / authentication process had been completed and with that the websocket
        connection had been established. The application should return true to indicate, that it is ready
        to receive messages. If false is returned, a call to AppWebsocketMessageComplete() is needed
        to receive messages.
        The default implementation is just an empty function, which returns true
    </p>
    <h2>virtual void AppWebsocketMessage(class json_io & msg, word base, const char * mt, const char * src)</h2>
    <p>
        Called by the library on received messages. The message is json decoded.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>class json_io & msg, word base</dt>
        <dd>
            The message as JSON data structure. base indicates the location of message inside the
            JSON structure
        </dd>
        <dt>const char * mt</dt>
        <dd>
            The message type, which is also part of the message as "mt" member.
        </dd>
        <dt>const char * src</dt>
        <dd>
            The "src" member of the message. This should be sent back with any response. It is
            used on the Javascript side to route the message to the object, which sent the request.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>void AppWebsocketMessageComplete()</h2>
    <p>
        Function to be called to acknowledge the last message. Unless this function is called no
        further message is received.
    </p>
    <h2>void AppWebsocketMessageSend(class json_io & msg, char * buffer)</h2>
    <p>
        Function which can be called to send a message. buffer should be a buffer big enough to
        hold the complete message. It is used only during the call to this function.
    </p>
    <h2>virtual void AppWebsocketSendResult(class IWebsocket * websocket)</h2>
    <p>
        Called by the library when the message is sent. The App should not send further messages
        unless this call is received, if the App wants to have flow control for bulk data. If flow
        control on application level is done, this function needs not to be implemented.
    </p>
    <h2>void AppWebsocketClose()</h2>
    <p>
        Can be called to request closing of the websocket connection
    </p>
    <h2>virtual void AppWebsocketClosed()</h2>
    <p>
        Called when the websocket connection is closed. It can be used to delete the App session
        (e.g. delete this).
