    <h1>Frame Buffer</h1>
    <p>
        The Frame Buffer is responsible for:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>capturing an application bitmap</li>
            <li>finding differences between bitmaps</li>
            <li>generating blocks with these differences</li>
            <li>compressing the blocks</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        It also enables to mark specific areas for retransmission in case messages are lost.
    </p>

    <hr /><h2>static IFrameBuffer * CreateFrameBuffer(UFrameBuffer * const user, callbackTrace * cbTrace)</h2>
    <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <p>
        Function to allocate the FrameBuffer Resource.<br />It receives as argument a FrameBuffer User class which should implement the callbacks for managing existing applications.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>void Capture(unsigned int appId)</dt>
        <dd>
            This function makes all the task described above, starting with the capture of an application bitmap till the generation of the compressed blocks.<br />
            It receives as argument the Id of the application to be captured.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>class CompressedBlock * GetNextBlock(unsigned int appId, bool retransmissions)</dt>
        <dd>
            Get next compressed block for an specific application. The blocks are provided from top-left corner to bottom-right corner<br />
            If retransmissions flag is false, blocks which were marked for retransmissions are skipped.
        </dd>

    <dl>
        <dt>void Mark(unsigned int appId, int coorX, int coorY, int dimX, int dimY)</dt>
        <dd>
            Mark an specific area of an application for retransmission.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>void Clean(unsigned int appId)</dt>
        <dd>
            Clean all information related to an application (bitmaps, blocks, ...).
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>void SubscribeApplications(void)</dt>
        <dd>
            The Frame Buffer will return throughout the UFrameBuffer class which applications are available for capturing.<br />
            The Frame Buffer will also inform about closed applications or updates in the name or description of the existing applications.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt>void UnsubscribeApplications(void)</dt>
        <dd>
            The Frame Buffer will not provide information to the application about the existing applications.
        </dd>

    <dl>
        <dt>void Add(unsigned int id, const char * name, const char * description)</dt>
