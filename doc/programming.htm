    <h3>Interfaces and Libraries for App Services</h3>
	<p> 
		For the implementation of app Services, to enable communication between App Services or the App Services 
		and system components of the App Platform (without any need for Linux knowledge)
		and also to support recurring and complex tasks this SDK provides you with a bunch of interfaces and libraries listed below:	
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr><td><b><a href="reference.htm#CPP_AppServiceInterfaces">App Service Interfaces (1)</a></b></td>
            <td>
                The App Service Interface is fundamental to implement your own App Services.
            </td>
        </tr>
		<tr><td><b><a href="reference.htm#CPP_AppPlatformLibraries">App Platform Libraries (2)</a></b></td>
            <td>
				App platform libraries provide access to complex functionality that is recurringly needed using App Platform interfaces.
            </td>
        </tr>
		<tr><td><b><a href="reference.htm#CPP_StandaloneLibraries">Standalone Libraries (3)</a></b></td>
            <td>
                This is a very portable libray for some fundamental features,
				like string manipulation, json encoding/decoding, binary trees
				and much more. It is a library also used within the innovaphone firmware.
            </td>
        </tr>
		<tr><td><b><a href="reference.htm#CPP_AppPlatformInterfaces">App Platform Interfaces (4)</a></b></td>
            <td>
                These libraries provide easy access to core components of the App Platform, such as Webwerver, Database, Sockets.
            </td>
        </tr>
	</table>

    <h3>Assynchrous programming environment</h3>
    <p>
        The innovaphone SDK is designed to completly work in an asynchronous, non-blocking way.
        Each IO operation is asynchronous. Same for timers and exec callbacks, used to to call a
        function asynchronous. All of that is controlled by the IIoMux instance of an AppInstance.
        Because of this, the IIoMux instance must be passed to nearly all interfaces on creation.
        The interface will take care of registering and unregistering itself to the IIoMux instance.
    </p>
    <p>
        So each apps needs to be design with the same manner, too. That means, that the app must
        implement good flowcontrol to not loose control of what is going on. Because of this, each
        nearly Interface has also a User class
        (generally with the same name as the interface, only starts with 'U' instead of 'I' - e. G.
        ISocket and USocket). The app must provide classes that will be subclasses of an user
        class and pass an instance of that user to the Interface when
        creating. So for example, if an application creates an instance of IHTTPClient,
        it must pass an instance of a subclass of UHTTPClient. That subclass needs to implement
        all callback functions that are of interest for the app. More informations of what functions
        must be overwritten and what functions having default implementation, can be found at the
        description of the interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally, each asynchronous function will lead in an result callback function
        (e. G. Send() -> SendResult()). If an app calls Send() of an interface that provides
        a Send() function, the app should wait until the SendResult() callback had
        been called before sending the nexxt part. Doing this helps to have non blockng operations.
        The same is for Recv(), wich will call a RecvResult() callback function if data had been
        received. While waiting for data to receive, the application can still handled other
        stuff (e. g. Recive a Websocket message). Each application instance has an IIoMux instance,
        wich finally will handle each type of connection, inform each interface of data that
        is available, handles timers and Execute-Callbacks, which can be used to call a function
        asynchronous.
    </p>

    <h3>PBX manager plugin</h3>
    <p>
        Each app service should provide a plugin for the PBX manager that is
        used for the configuration by the admin. It can be used to change the settings of an app instance
        and to maintain the corresponding app objects in the PBX.
        See <a href="../web/com.innovaphone.manager/pbx_manager_plugin.htm">PBX Manager plugin</a> for details.
