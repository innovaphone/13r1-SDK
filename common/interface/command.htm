    <h1>command</h1>
    <p>
        Interface for asyncronously operating on new commands.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: currently the implementation is done in a separate thread for each new command, <br />
        as there is no possibility to read or write asynchronously from file descriptors.
    </p>
    <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <hr /><h2>class ICommandProvider * CreateCommandProvider(class IIoMux * iomux)</h2>
    <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
    <p>
        Function to allocate the CommandProvider resource, to be called from the app-main, so that the real
        CommandProvider can be replaced by a unit-test implementation.
    </p>
    <h2>class ICommand * CreateCommand(class IInstanceLog * const log, class UTask * user, const char * command, int expectedExitCode, size_t initialReadLength = 0)</h2>
    <p>
        Creates a new instance of ICommand. ICommand is derived from ITask, so the ITask/UTask mechanisms are used for progress and completion.<br />
        The ITask::Start function is called inside CreateCommand, so it is not needed to call this function on your own.
        <dl>
            <dt>class IInstanceLog * const log</dt>
            <dd>The related log interface.</dd>
            <dt>class UTask * user</dt>
            <dd>The UTask user which shall receive the UTask callbacks.</dd>
            <dt>const char * command</dt>
            <dd>The command which will be executed, e.g. <i>ls -l /var/</i>.</dd>
            <dt>int expectedExitCode</dt>
            <dd>If expectedExitCode is < 0, the exit code is not checked, otherwise TaskFailed is triggered if the exit code does not match.</dd>
            <dt>size_t initialReadLength</dt>
            <dd>If initialReadLength is > 0, the read function is called with length at once.</dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <hr /><h2>ICommand</h2>
    <p>
        ICommand class for read/write operation on an executed command. The buffer of the read data is maintained within this class.<br/>
        STDERR is automatically redirected and can be fetched afterwards with Error(). Note that max 8192 bytes are fetched from STDERR, the remaining data is discarded.
        <h3>General handling</h3>
        The TaskProgress progress parameter is used differently, depending on a previous Read or Write. Valid values are:
        <ul>
            <li>COMMAND_PROGRESS_READ</li>
            <li>COMMAND_PROGRESS_WRITE</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The <i>TaskComplete</i> callback is triggered when the process has terminated and all data has been read or after ICommand::Close() has been called.<br /></li>
            <li>The <i>TaskFailed</i> callback is triggered when something failed. In this case the command has already terminated.</li>
            <li>The <i>TaskProgress(this, COMMAND_PROGRESS_READ)</i> callback is triggered after a previous Read(...) call when the data is available. You can retrieve the data with Get() afterwards.</li>
            <li>The <i>TaskProgress(this, COMMAND_PROGRESS_WRITE)</i> callback is triggered after a previous Write(...) call when the data has been written.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>void Read(size_t length)</dt>
            <dd>
                Initiates reading of the next block. May be called after TaskProgress for the
                previous block.<br />
                You mustn't call several reads without waiting for the TaskProgress callback which indicates that the data has been read.
            </dd>
            <dt>void Get(const byte * & data, size_t & length)</dt>
            <dd>
                Gets a pointer to the read block of data. May be called after the TaskProgress
                for the read operation. The pointer is valid until the next call to Read.                If the length is not equal to the length of a previous Read call, the end of the stream is reached and you'll get a TaskComplete/TaskFailed afterwards.
            </dd>
            <dt>void Write(byte * data, size_t length, bool last = false)</dt>
            <dd>
                Initiates writing of <i>data</i> with the given <i>length</i>. May be called after TaskProgress for the previous block.<br />
                You mustn't call several writes without waiting for the TaskProgress callback which indicates that the data has been written.<br />
                <i>last</i> indicates that this is the last block.<br />
                On last=true, the writing file descriptor will be closed. Depending on the used command, this maybe the first point where<br />
                a Read can be issued after a previous Write.
            </dd>
            <dt>void Close()</dt>
            <dd>
                Terminates the process if it is still running. You do not need to call Close() if you do not want to kill the process before it ends on its own.
            </dd>
            <dt>const char * Error()</dt>
            <dd>
                Returns the output of STDERR or NULL if nothing has been written to STDERR.
            </dd>
        </dl>
