    <h2><a name="getting_started">Getting started</a></h2>
    <p>
        To start developing apps using innovaphone SDK, we highly recommnend to use Visual Studio 2017 or newer. While you can use what ever IDE or environment you whant to use,
        the benefit of using Visual Studio is our integration. The innovaphone SDK comes with a Visual Studio extension to integrate everything you need into the IDE. So managing
        connections to the PBX or the AppPlatform itself will be handled by the extension. It also offers a template which can be used as an example or as basis for your own app.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you havn't done yet, download Visual Studio from the Microsoft page. Depending on your company it could be, that you even can use the free Communmity Edition of Visual Studio.
        Look at the Microsoft Visual Studio homepage for more information. It is important to select the Workload "Linux development with C++":<br/><br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_Install_Linux_Tools.png">
        <br/><br/>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Due a bug in some version of Visual Studio 2017, make sure to install at least version 15.9.6 or newer!
    </p>
    <p>
        After installing Visual Studio, run the innovaphone SDK setup (or run it again if already done), to install the Visual Sutdio extension. If everything had been installed, you
        are ready to go. The following guide shows you, how to setup the environment and start producing Apps. Please note that the following documentation is based on the usage for
        Visual Studio 2017, but should be the same on newer version (more or less, depending on how much Microsoft has changed the UI).
    </p>
    <p>
        The following parts will guide you step-by-step through the process from creating an app, setting up the connections needed and run your app to debug it. It is recommended
        to read this document to understand how to use the innovaphone SDK and the Visual Studio integration. <br/>
    </p>
    
    <br/>
    <h3><a name="start">Run Visual Studio</a></h3>
    <p>
        After you start Visual Studio you shoukd wait for the innovaphone SDK extension to be initialized. Visual Studio whants the extension to be loaded asynchronously
        and there is no way to tell, that this extension need to be loaded before the user can open a project using the innovaphone SDK. But normaly it only takes a couple
        of seconds. However, you <i>can</i> open a solution or create a new project before the extension has been initialized, but this will lead to a delayed initialization
        of the extension and with that maybe some dialogs that will be displayed while you already start typing. And also some menu items will be disabled until initialization
        is completed. So finally you need to wait, so it may be better to wait before opening an innovaphone SDK project.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can verify that the extension had been loaded by checking the output pane (View - Output - Show output from: innovaphone SDK).
        This pane also is your place to go to get additional information on what is going on in an case of an error. Every message will be posted as a log message to the it. <br/>
        After the extension had been initialized it should look like the screenshot below:
        look similary to the screenshot below:<br/><br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_Output_Pane.png"/>
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3><a name="new_project">Create a new project</a></h3>
    <p>
        Now you're ready to start your first innovaphone SDK project. For this, create a new project (File - New - Project). The innovaphone SDK app template can be found under
        Installed - Visual C++, innovaphone App. Enter a name for the app and click on ok. While you're free to give what ever name you whant, it is recommended to not
        use spaces our special characters, because that name will be used inside the source code as name for the classes and Visual Studio will replace spaces and special chars
        by an underline. Technically it works, but it looks aweful. Also let Visual Studio a directory for the solution (which will be enabled by default).<br/>
        <br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_New_Project.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        After the project had been created, you must install the SDK to the project. That means, that the SDK files will be copied to the source of the new created app. The innovaphone
        SDK extension will do that for you, so just click on start. You can also cancel it, but your app won't compile (however, this also can be done later, see menu items). After the
        files had been copied, your will be lead to the next step which is defining the connections you need to run.<br/>
        <br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_Install_SDK.png">
        <br/>        
    </p>
    
    <br/>
    <h3><a name="remoteconnection">Assign a remote connection</a></h3>
    <p>
        Before creating your own app, you must at first understsand, how an app for the innovaphone AppPlatform works. This is importent to understand, how you need to setup the
        connections in Visual Studio used during development.<br/>
        <br/>
        An app generally has two parts: the UI, written with JavaScript/CSS/html, executed using a web browser or myApps, and the service, written in C++. The C++ part will be
        cross-compiled on your Windows development machine using gcc shipped with the innovaphone SDK. Compiling under an other platform like macOS or Linux is not supported
        (even if the service itself will run on a Linux OS). However, a service must have at least one instance. The instance is finally that part the UI will connect to.<br/>
        <br/>
        So to run the app and make the UI available on myApps, the PBX and the AppPlatform must be configured for the your app and the app itself must be deployed to the AppPlatform.
        While this can be done manually, the innovaphone SDK extension helps out a lot managing that stuff. This is why you need to setup a bunch of "connections". There
        are three types of connections:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>AppPlatform connection:</b> This is the connection to the AppPlatform, technically a TCP connection to the AppPlatforms Linux OS.</li>
            <li><b>PBX connection:</b> To use the app on myApps or with a web browser, an PBX object for your app must be created. For this, the PBX connection is needed which
            is the TCP address of the PBX that connects to the service / AppPlatform.</li>
            <li><b>Remote connection:</b> This is the connection to the service, based on the AppPlatform connection. Actually this is the user / password for an AppPlatform connection
            to login using SSH. This is why it is called remote connection..</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        So the remote connection toghether with the AppPlatform connection is the information the innovaphone SDK extension needs to get access to the AppPlatform, configure the
        service, add an instance, deploy the binary and access the service using SSH to be able to debug it from within Visul Studio. While the PBX connection is used to setup the
        PBX app object, that is necessary for the UI to work and to let the PBX connect to your service via websocket. Please note that this also will enable the developer mode on
        both, the PBX as well as the AppPlatform.
    </p>                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
    <p>
        The first of that connections your'll be asked about, is the remote connection. The name of this connection - which is the name of the service and because of this should always
        be the same as the name of the project - will also be used to setup the database system. So if there is a connection with the same name as your project available, this connection
        will be selected by default. If not, you need to create a new one by opening the drop down box and clicking on "Create new connection":<br/><br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_Add_Rremote_Connection.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Connections only be avlaiable for debug builds and depends on the selected platform (arm or x64).
    </p>
    
    <br/>
    <h3><a name="addremoteconnection">Add remote connection</a></h3>
    <p>
        To add a new remote connection for your app, you must select the AppPlatform used for the app. If there is an already configured AppPlatform for the same platform type as
        your app (arm, x64), that one will be selected automatically. If not, you must create a new AppPlatform connection by clicking on "New AppPlatform connection". (Look below to
        learn about howto add a new AppPlatform connection). After adding a new AppPlatform connection, it will automatically be selected in the dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
        After selecting the AppPlatform connection, or in case that the connection had been selected automatically, all services the AppPlatform knows will be placed int the combo box
        "Service name". If there is a service compinging with the name of your new app, that name will be selected automatically. If not, do not use an other service name. Generally the
        service name (which finally will be the remote connection) must be the same as the name of your app. Note that some names are reserved. In that case, you will get an error message
        and need to change the name of your project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also make sure that "Assign PBX AppObject" is selected. (If you can not select it, there is no PBX connection assigned with the AppPlatform connection). The available app objects
        will be listed in the "AppObjct name" dropdown box and - you might guess it - if one of them combines with the name of your app, it will be selected. If not, enter a name (and yes,
        again use the same as the name of your object). The AppObject UIR will be entered automatically buy using the IP address of the AppPlatform and the name of your app. You can change
        it, if you whant by editing the app object in the PBX admin page.<br/><br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_Add_Rremote_Connection.png"><br/>
        <br/>
        <b>NOTE:</b> There are some names for your service aka project and the needed connection, that youre not allowed to use. The extension will show an message if you're co
    </p>
    
    <br/>
    <h3><a name="newappplatformconnection">New AppPlatform connection</a></h3>
    <p>
        Adding a new AppPlatform connection is quite simple. Only a couple of data must be given. This is a unique name for the connection, the IP address of the AppPlatform and the password
        (generally the administration password given during the installation of the pbx - is the same needed when accessing the app manager using a browser). Even if you can create such
        a connection withouth a PBX connection, it generally is not a good idea. So also enter the IP adress of PBX with the admin user name (generally admin, if not changed) and the password
        (also set during installation).<br/><br/>
        <img src="pics/VSE_New_AppPlatform_Connection.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        To finalize click on connect. The innovaphone SDK extension will now establish a connection to the AppPlatform and PBX, enable developer mode for both of them and save the AppPlatform
        connection, which can now be used. In case of an error, you will get an message telling you why the connection could not be established.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> The innovaphone SDK extension uses the Visual Studio Linux development layer to save and load the connection information. Because of this, that connections
        are visible if you go to "Tools - Options - Crossplatform". But <b>never ever</b> delete or edit them there! This can break up the whole connection managment of the extension and
        your app no longer can be deployed and debugged. If you whant to delete connections (or add new ones), use the Connection Manager that is part of the innovaphone SDK extension (see below).
    </p>

    <h3><a name="runanddebug">Run and debug your application</a></h3>
    <p>
        After setting up everythign, you're ready to compile and debug your app. Just set a breakpoint and click on run (or press F5) to go. If everything is allright, Visual Studio will
        compile the app, deploy the binary and start debugging it using GDB over SSH. More about debugging with Visual Studio can be found in the Visual Studio documentation.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <h3><a href="#additional_tools">Additional tipps development</a></h3>
    <p>
        Beside the debuging capatilities, here are some additional tipps:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><u>Use logging:</u></b><br/>
        The innovaphone SDK provides a interface to log messages from your app. This can be done by using the IInstanceLog class. This class is not only useful during development, also after
        development a user can activate logging for your app. Beside this, all innovaphone SDK inferfaces using this logging system, helping you to find out what's going on. You can also use
        debug->printf(), but this type of logging isn't instance dependend and thus only should be used during development. More more information, read the
        <a href="../../common/os/debug.htm">debug documentation</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        <b><u>Use valgrind</u></b><br/>
        Valgrind is a tool to find memory related problems in an app. While the drawback is, that your app will run very slow (up to 40% slower), but only during the debugging session using valgrind.
        An other drawback is, that you need to run valgrind manually. You need to connect to the AppPlatform using a SSH terminal and use the user for your app to login. The user and password normaly
        is the same as the name of your app, all in lower case. You also can use the innovaphone SDK menus to start a SSH terminal session (see below). When logged in, use the following commands to
        start valgrind with your app (replacing "appname" with the name of your application):<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>chmod +x /apps/appname/appname</i><br/>
        <i>valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --error-exitcode=1 /apps/appname/appname</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Valgrind now will start executing your app, catching all memory related operations. Doing this, it will find different kind of memory related errors: writing out of bound (even 1 byte),
        accessing previously release memory (including object instances), not releasing memory, etc. This helps a lot to write clean progrems that takes care of a good memory management.
        A sample of an error can look like this (this is a synthetic error log for demonstration reason, because releasing the debug object
        is handled by the SDK):

        <b><u>Read the SDK documentation</u></b><br/>
        The innovaphone SDK works in an asynchronously way. This maybe a form of programming you're not used to it, so it will be a good idea to read the documentation carefully to know which call
        will lead to which callback, what to take care of, how to create instances of the interfaces, when to release them, etc. There are some examples that help you using the SDK.<br/>

        <b><u>Visit our forum</u></b><br/>
        In our fourm at <a href="http://forum.innovaphone.com/">http://forum.innovaphone.com/</a>, there is an are for the SDK development. This will be the best place to talk to other developers (including
        the ones from innovaphone), exhange ideas, solutions, knowhow and get support. We're looking forward to hear from you to and your expoerience with the innovaphone SDK.

    <p>
        The innovaphone SDK extension provides some menu items (Tools - innovaphone SDK) to help you during development of your app as well as managing the connections. There is also a toolbar (if the toolbar is not
        visible, right click on the toolbar section and select innovaphone SDK). The meaning of the icons of the toolbar can be show by puting the mouse over them and wait for the tooltip
        or by comparing them with the items in the innovaphone SDK menu:<br/>

        The innovaphone Connection Manager is the place where you can edit and add Remote Connections as well as AppPlatform Connections. You have two tabs The first one is "Remote Connection", where you
        can remove and test connections as well as add new ones. The second one is "AppPlatform Connections". Beside removing, testing and addin new connections, you can also access the AppPlatform
        manager of a selected connection as well as the PBX UI assigned to it. Not that whatever changed had been made, they only will be saved when closing the Connetion Manager by clicking on Accept.
        If the Connection Manager will be closed by pressing ESC or clicking on the X of the windows, changes made will be discarded.

        A: Run the innovaphone SDK setup to get the latest version. The next time you're opening an innophaone SDK project, the extension will check the version of the installed SDK and the available one and
           in case that a newer had been detected, ask for updating the SDK in your project.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: The app won't compile because some files of the SDK cannot be found.<br/>
        A: Reinstall the SDK by using the innovaphone SDK menu item.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: When updateing or installing the SDK, I got an error message that some files cannot be copied or deleted because they are accessed by an other process.<br/>
        A: This happens sometimes. In that case, close ALL open Visual Studio instances, make sure that no other process has acces to the directory of files of your project, reopen Visual Studio, open
           your project and try it again. Alternativly you can copy the files manually.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: I click on "Assign Remote Connection", but nothing happens.<br/>
        A: Make sure that you have selected the debug profile. For release builds remote connections cannot be assigned.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: I whant to backup the connection settings, how can I do that?<br/>
        A: Well, the files are stored under %APPDATA%\innovaphone\VisualStudioPackage. Make a backup of the while VisualStudioPackage directory. But you also need to backup the connections managed
           by the Visual Studio Linux development layer. This files can be found under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Linux\User Data\3.0\store.xml. When restoring, make sure that the directory structure
           of the later is correct.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: Everything works, but it seems that there is not VisualStudioPackage directory under %APPDATA%\innovaphone.<br/>
        A: Maybe that directory for the connection store had been changed. Look to the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\innovaphone\innovaphoneSDK, the key AppPlatformStore. Be
           careful to not edit the values in the registry until you're completly know what you're doing.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: I've accidentally deleted the connection info in the Visual Studio options unter cross platform. What can I do now?<br/>
        A: Open the innovaphone SDK Connection Manager, delete every entry depending on the deleted Linux connection and create them again. Note that you also need to reasign that connection to
           your project.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: The menu items or toolbar buttons for opening a Linux SSH terminal or usign WinSCP are grayed out.<br/>
        A: You must define the applications to use for them during the innovaphone SDK setup. Just run the setup again to change that settings.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: I've created a project an not assigned a remote connection. But according to the Visual Studio run button, there is an assigned connection but it doesn't work.<br/>
        A: When not assigning a remote connection, Visual Studio will take the first connection available. But this won't work, so you need to assign it before you try to run and debug your app.<br/>
        <br/>
        Q: I've some problems or other questions regarding the innovaphone SDK or the Visual Studio extension, so where can I ask them?<br/>
        A: Go to the innovaphone forum at <a href="http://forum.innovaphone.com/">http://forum.innovaphone.com</a> - there is a forum for the SDK. Be welcome, we're glad to hear from you.<br/>
