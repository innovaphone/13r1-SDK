    <h1>httpfile</h1>
    <p>
        httpfile is a class used by the IWebserverPlugin to realize static files. A static file that will be provided
		by the IWebserverPlugin needs to converted with the httpfiles tool and added to the project during the building
		process (have a look to the API demo to see how to implement static files). Each file that will be statically
		included will be represented by an httpfile instance and placed inside a btree. So generally there is no need
		to use the httpfile class "manually".
		<br><b>NOTE:</b> The interface of httpfile is compatible to the innovaphone firmware internals.

    <h2> class httpfile</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>httpfile(const char * fileName, word /* servlettype unused */, word theFlags, byte * data, size_t dataSize)</dt>
        <dd>
			fileName is the name of the static file. The name can include a path (e. G. "/main/index.html"). theFlags currently
			only supports the flag HTTP_GZIP. If that flag is set, the data of the file must be in gzip compressed format.
			The Webserver will set the proper encoding when sending the file to the browser. data is a pointer to the data of
			the file, dataSize the size of the file. The resource type of the file will be autodetected by parsing the file 
			suffix.
        </dd>

        <dt>const byte * GetData()</dt>
        <dd>
            Returns the pointer to the buffer passed to the constructor.
        </dd>

        <dt>size_t GetSize()</dt>
        <dd>
			Returns the size of the file as given to the constructor.
        </dd>

        <dt>word GetResourceType()</dt>
        <dd>
			Returns the resource type of the file. That value will send from the webbrowser as content-type header field. The
			constructor of httpfile autodetecst the resource type by parsing the file suffix.
        </dd>
		
        <dt>word GetFlags()</dt>
        <dd>
			Returns the flags that had been given to the constructor of httpfiles. For now, only HTTP_GZIP is supported.
        </dd>
		
        <dt>const char * GetMD5String()</dt>
        <dd>
			Returns the MD5 sum of the file content. This value will be calculated when in the constructor of httpfile and
			used by IWenserverPlugin / Webserver as etag to support the browsers file caching.
        </dd>
