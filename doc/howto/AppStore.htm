    <h1>The AppStore</h1>

    <p>
        The AppStore is used to store Apps, Firmware, Software and App Platforms and these can be downloaded afterwards from the app itself or from the download page. 
        To upload a new release to the AppStore, 3 uploads must be done: one for the Apps, one for the Firmware and one for the Software. 
        For every app, device and software there must be a file named like <b>itemID_files</b>, which contains the names of the binaries that should be uploaded to the AppStore for this item. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The upload of a new build for the apps can be done with the upload menu, which is displayed by clicking on the <b>Update</b> button (upper-right corner). To upload the build for all the current apps on the AppStore, click on <b>Select all</b> and edit the Release, Build and Label data on the first row. The changes will be automatically applied to all the apps. With the Upload button the binaries of the selected apps are uploaded to the AppStore. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="../pics/HowTo_AppStore_Upload_Apps.jpg">
        <br />
        <br />
        If an error is displayed after the upload saying that some file could not be found, please check if the path of the apps are correct. These should be like this one (where xxxx is the id of the app): 
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>http://build-dfs.innovaphone.com/13r1/apps/xxxx</li>
        </ul>
        If the path is correct, check that inside that folder there is a folder named as the build number. It should contain a file called xxxx_files (which contains the names of the files that will be uploaded to the AppStore for the given app) and 2 folders with the binaries (arm and x86_64). 
    </p>

    <h3><a name="upload_firmware">How to upload a firmware</a></h3>

        <ul>
            <li>http://build-dfs.innovaphone.com/13r1/ipxxxx</li>
        </ul>
        If the path is correct, check that the folder contains a folder named as the build number. These should contain the binaries and the id_files file for the given device. For example, for the device IP1200, inside <i>http://build-dfs.innovaphone.com/13r1/ip1200/131779</i> you should find: boot1200.bin, ip1200.bin and ip1200_files. For 12r2 and older it is ok if the ipxxxx_files files are not found on firmware. On this case, the boot and ip files are uploaded as default.

    <!-- Folder Structure -->

    <h2><a name="folder_structure">Folder Structure</a></h2>
    <p>
        To upload apps, firmwares, softwares and app platforms a <i>path</i> is required, which has to point to a folder that contains the builds. These must be named after the build number.
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="../pics/HowTo_AppStore_path_builds.jpg">
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>

    <h3><a name="folder_apps">Apps</a></h3>
    <p>
        Every build folder must contain an <b>appid_files</b> file where a list of the files that must be uploaded will be splited by commas (without white spaces). For example, "appstore.bin,appstore.debug,appstore.png".
        The binaries must be placed inside 2 folders which paths should look like this:
        <ul>
        <li><i>path</i>/130001/<b>arm</b>/appstore</li>
        <li><i>path</i>/130001/<b>x86_64</b>/appstore</li>
        </ul>
        
        So if <i>path</i> is the path given in the appstore, the paths of all the files must be:
        <ul>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/appstore_files</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/arm/appstore/appstore.bin</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/arm/appstore/appstore.debug</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/arm/appstore/appstore.png</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/x86_64/appstore/appstore.bin</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/x86_64/appstore/appstore.debug</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/x86_64/appstore/appstore.png</li>
        </ul>        
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="folder_firmware">Firmware</a></h3>
    <p>
        Every build folder must contain an <b>firmwareid_files</b> file where a list of the files that must be uploaded will be splited by commas (without white spaces). For example, "ip0001.bin,boot0001.bin".
    So if <i>path</i> is the path given in the appstore, the paths of all the files must be:    
        <ul>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/ip0001_files</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/ip0001.bin</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/boot0001.bin</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="folder_software">Software</a></h3>
    <p>
        Every build folder must contain an <b>softwareid_files</b> file where a list of the files that must be uploaded will be splited by commas (without white spaces). For example, "myAppsSetup.exe".
        So if <i>path</i> is the path given in the appstore, the paths of all the files must be:
        <ul>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/myappswindows_files</li>
            <li><i>path</i>/130001/myAppsSetup.exe</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3><a name="folder_appplatform">App Platform</a></h3>
    <p>
        The files that must be uploaded should be specified inside the fields File, Update, ZIP and ZIP2. Those must be inside a folder named as the build number, which is inside a folder named app-platform.
        So if <i>path</i> is the path given in the appstore, the paths of all the files must look like:
        <ul>
            <li><i>path</i>/<b>app-platform</b>/80008/file.bin</li>
